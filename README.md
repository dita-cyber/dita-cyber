ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephani 

I'm an IT professional with over five years of experience in the field, currently working in Security as a SOC Analyst. 

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to experience various IT topics and work on diverse projects that have broadened my expertise and skill set.

My journey in IT has been both challenging and rewarding. I began by studying IT fundamentals on my own, which led to my first experience at Geek Squad. From there, I transitioned to a help desk support position and later joined a cybersecurity startup as a SIEM technician, where I developed my cybersecurity skills over nearly two years. I then moved internally to the SOC, where I have been a Level 1 analyst for a year. Prior to my IT career, I had over 10 years of experience in Marketing.

Current certifications:

- GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)
- GIAC Security Essentials Certification (GSEC)
- GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies (GFACT)
- CompTia Security+
- CompTia Network+
- CompTia A+
- CompTia ITF+
- Microsoft 365 Certified: Fundamentals AZ-900
- Palo Alto Networks Certified Cybersecurity Entry-level Technician

I'm excited to share my experiences and insights with you.
